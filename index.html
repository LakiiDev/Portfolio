            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a junior Frontend Web Developer. I have a lot of experience with frontend web development. With my knowledge I create successful websites that are fast, easy to use and accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main areas of my expertise are <b>HTML, SASS, and Javascript  </b> frameworks. I take great pride in my work, and I always try to better myself with every project I work on. I like to write semantic, cross-browser compatible code by hand that is re-useable, maintainable, and easy to understand.
            </p>
            <p>Also, I would call myself an open-minded and reliable person. I am also a hard-working person which means that I take every project seriously.</p>

                            <p>The task for this project was to make a responsive animated page for the designing company. Also one of the goals was to make a functional page in which are sections differentiated by some vibrant colours. </p>
                            <p>I was able to achieve this using semantic HTML, CSS grid and at the end flexboxes. The layout was pretty straight forward and the final product looked as intended. This project reminded me of the importance of grid layouts. </p>
                            <p>In the end, all criteria were fulfilled, which lead to the final product you can see at the moment.</p>

                            <p>The objective of this project was to make a fully animated and responsive website for a company which specializes in the gaming VR industry. Using the given instructions, my task was to develop a page which would appeal to the gaming community.</p>
                            <p>
                            Using my knowledge I was able to make this happen using some JS libraries (specifically GSAP) and using a CSS grid layout. The most difficult thing on that page was the creations section, but I completed it without any hesitation.</p>
                            <p> All in all, on this project I learned some new properties and tricks about CSS grids which could come in handy in future. The final product was completed as planned with a few extra things.</p>

                            <p>This was my first project in which the main goal was to make a functional web page with a representative QR code. Also, it required making the dark theme for the website. As for the cherry on top, some simple animations were essential.</p>
                            <p>I thought it was my first, it didn't take me to log to put things in the right place. I achieved a dark theme using some CSSS variables which are vital across every page I am working on.</p>
                            <p>To conclude, in it I haven't learned a lot of things which are related to HTML/CSS, although I learned some new things related to JS. For the first time, the product ended the way it was intended.</p>

                            <p>This was my last project and certainly the most complex one. The goal of it was to make a responsive and functional webpage for a banking agency. It was crucial for it to be attractive and it was required to have a certain layout. Animations were here very important because they could drive away customers at any time.</p>
                            <p>On this webpage, I used technologies from the HTML/CSS which I would normally use such as grids, flexboxes and etc. The trickier part here was animations. For that purpose, I used GSAP Library combined with my own JS code.</p>
                            <p>In the end, the page ended up being really stunning. This project has taught me things that I'll most certainly use in future projects. Also, I would love to work on similar projects, because it was really a pleasure doing this.</p>
